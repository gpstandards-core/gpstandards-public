    <h1>Master Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 15, 2026</p>
    
    <p>This Master Services Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between <strong>Genesis & Prime Standards LLC</strong>, a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in Wilmington, Delaware ("Provider", "G&P", or "We"), and the entity or person accessing the Services ("Customer" or "You").</p>
    
    <p>BY ACCESSING, DEPLOYING, OR UTILIZING THE G&P SOVEREIGN INTELLIGENCE ARCHITECTURE, YOU IRREVOCABLY AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT INITIATE THE UPLINK.</p>

    <h2>Article 1: Definitions & Interpretation</h2>
    <p><strong>1.1 "Digital Workers"</strong> refers to the proprietary autonomous agents (including but not limited to 'The Revenue Reclaimer', 'The Zoning Sentinel', and 'The Conflict Engine') deployed by G&P into Customer environments.</p>
    <p><strong>1.2 "Sovereign Architecture"</strong> refers to the orchestrated combination of vector databases, model weights, API bridges (MCP), and security protocols provided by G&P.</p>
    <p><strong>1.3 "Hallucination"</strong> refers to the inherent probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate factually incorrect or nonsensical information.</p>

    <h2>Article 2: License Grant & Restrictions</h2>
    <p><strong>2.1 Limited License.</strong> Subject to payment of applicable fees, G&P grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to access and use the Digital Workers solely for internal business operations during the Term.</p>
    <p><strong>2.2 Restrictions.</strong> Customer shall not, directly or indirectly: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the model weights or proprietary algorithms; (b) use the Services to build a competitive product; (c) attempt to bypass the "Air-Gap" or egress controls without authorization.</p>

    <h2>Article 3: The "Nature of AI" Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><strong>3.1 Probabilistic Output.</strong> Customer acknowledges that Artificial Intelligence is probabilistic, not deterministic. G&P Standards makes no warranty, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of outputs generated by the Digital Workers.</p>
    <p><strong>3.2 Human-in-the-Loop Mandate.</strong> Customer agrees to maintain a "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL) protocol. A qualified human professional must review all high-stakes outputs (including court filings, financial audits, and zoning applications) prior to external use. G&P Standards shall not be liable for any errors, omissions, or "hallucinations" utilized by Customer without such review.</p>

    <h2>Article 4: Data Sovereignty & Security</h2>
    <p><strong>4.1 Zero Retention (ZDR).</strong> G&P covenants that it enforces a Zero Data Retention policy for inference data on its foundational model layers. Customer Data is processed in ephemeral instances (US-East-4) and is not stored by G&P for model training purposes.</p>
    <p><strong>4.2 Customer Ownership.</strong> As between the parties, Customer retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Customer Data (e.g., case files, rent rolls). G&P acquires no rights in such data, other than the limited right to process it for the duration of the requested operation.</p>

    <h2>Article 5: Fees & "No Cure, No Pay" Pilot</h2>
    <p><strong>5.1 Pilot Audits.</strong> For engagements explicitly designated as "Executive Clearance Audits" or "Pilot Deployments," the Pilot Fee is refundable solely if the Digital Worker fails to identify the minimum recoverable revenue metric defined in the Statement of Work (SOW) within the pilot period (e.g., 30 days).</p>
    <p><strong>5.2 Determination.</strong> The determination of "recoverable revenue" shall be based exclusively on the forensic logs generated by the Revenue Reclaimer agent. Customer's failure to act on the findings does not constitute a failure of the Service.</p>

    <h2>Article 6: Indemnification</h2>
    <p><strong>6.1 By Customer.</strong> Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless G&P Standards, its officers, directors, and agents from and against any claims, damages, or liabilities arising out of: (a) Customer's use of the Services in violation of applicable law (including HIPAA, GDPR, or Attorney-Client Privilege regulations); (b) Customer's data content; or (c) Customer's reliance on unverified AI outputs.</p>

    <h2>Article 7: Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p><strong>7.1 CAP ON LIABILITY.</strong> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL G&P STANDARDS' AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER HEREUNDER IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE LAST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.</p>
    <p><strong>7.2 EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.</strong> IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.</p>

    <h2>Article 8: Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p><strong>8.1 Delaware Jurisdiction.</strong> This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.</p>
    <p><strong>8.2 Binding Arbitration.</strong> Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in Wilmington, Delaware. The language of the arbitration shall be English.</p>

    <h2>Article 9: General Provisions</h2>
    <p><strong>9.1 Force Majeure.</strong> G&P shall not be liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, terrorism, riots, or civil disturbances, or significant failure of the internet or cloud infrastructure providers (e.g., Azure outages).</p>
    <p><strong>9.2 Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, written or oral, concerning its subject matter.</p>
