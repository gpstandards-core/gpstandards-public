# G&P Standards: Sovereign Infrastructure Public Repository

### ⚠️ NOTICE OF SCOPE
This repository serves as the **public transparency and documentation layer** for G&P Standards.
It contains public-facing web assets, governance methodologies, and compliance statements.

**EXCLUSIONS:**
* **NO** proprietary algorithms or "Verbalized Sampling" logic cores are hosted here.
* **NO** client data, case files, or rent rolls are accessible via this repository.
* **NO** internal "Sovereign Agent" weights or configurations are present.

### Purpose
To provide transparent, auditable access to G&P Standards' public operational frameworks, demonstrating alignment with:
* ISO/IEC 42001 (Artificial Intelligence Management System)
* EU AI Act Transparency Requirements
* NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF)

### Architecture
This site is deployed as a static asset to ensure zero-attack-surface for dynamic injection. It represents the "air-gapped" philosophy we apply to client infrastructure.

### Accessibility
We are committed to WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. See `/accessibility/accessibility-statement.md` for details.
